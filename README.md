# elearning_group_project

This project aims to develop a mobile e-learning application designed to provide students with an accessible platform for learning, featuring courses that allow users to create their own flashcards, quizzes, and study notes while also generating tests and exercises using AI based on their existing study notes. Additionally, the app will include a camera feature, allowing users to capture images of handwritten notes or problems to incorporate into their study resources.
